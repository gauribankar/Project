Newly hatched young are only about six to eight inches (15 to 20 centimeters) long, and very vulnerable. Their mother protects them from predators, which include raccoons, bobcats, birds, and even other alligators. The young alligators stay with their mother for up to two years.

Those that live in deserts are most often brown. They often change color to warm up or cool down. They also switch shades to communicate with other chameleons. Over 150 species of chameleons exist, ranging from the size of your thumbnail to that of a house cat.  Their eyes can move in two different directions at once, giving them a panoramic view of their surroundings. The outer layer of their skin is see-through. Beneath that are layers of special cells filled with pigmentâ€”the substance that gives plants and animals (including you) color. To display a new color, the brain sends a message for these cells to get bigger or smaller. As this happens, pigments from different cells are released, and they mix with each other to create new skin tones."

And the burrows can get pretty crowded. As many as 25 desert tortoises might bunk together in one shelter. Once itâ€™s had a good drink, a desert tortoise can go up to a year without requiring fresh water again. Desert tortoises are pretty solitary. Sometimes when they come across each other, theyâ€™ll fight to establish dominance. The dueling duo may use horns on their chests to try and knock each other over.

It sinks its venom-filled fangs into its prey to knock it out, then swallows it in one gulp. When facing predators, king cobras try to act like tough guys.

When hunting, Komodo dragons rely on camouflage and patience, lying in bushes or tall grasses until a victim passes by. They pounce on their prey with powerful legs and sharp claws, then sink their jagged, sharklike teeth in. An animal that escapes the jaws of a Komodo won't feel lucky for long. Dragon saliva contains large amounts of bacteria, which poisons their victims, usually within 24 hours. Dragons will calmly follow their bitten prey for miles, using their keen sense of smell to find the corpse. They have been known to eat up to 80 percent of their body weight in a single feeding."

Once prevalent in every ocean except the Arctic and Antarctic, the leatherback population is rapidly declining in many parts of the world. While all other sea turtles have hard, bony shells, the inky-blue carapace of the leatherback is somewhat flexible and almost rubbery to the touch. Ridges along the carapace help give it a more hydrodynamic structure.

            description: "These beautifully colored sea turtles got their name because their oversized head sort of looks like a big log. Loggerhead turtles are the most abundant of all the marine turtle species in U.S. waters. But persistent population declines due to pollution, shrimp trawling, and development in their nesting areas, among other factors, have kept this wide-ranging seagoer on the threatened species list since 1978. Their enormous range encompasses all but the most frigid waters of the world's oceans. They seem to prefer coastal habitats, but often frequent inland water bodies and will travel hundreds of miles out to sea."

            description: "Rattlesnakes live in many places and habitats in the Western Hemisphere, from mountains to deserts and plains. There are more than 24 rattlesnake species and all of them have that most-famous feature: the rattle! The rattle is found at the tip of the rattlesnakeâ€™s tail. The snake uses the rattle to warn potential aggressors to back off or to distract prey. The famous rattle noise comes from the sound created when hollow and bony segments in the rattle bang together. Like other snakes, rattlesnakes donâ€™t have ears and canâ€™t hear most sounds. They detect movement by sensing vibrations in the ground. Their eyes see well even in low light. The rattlesnakeâ€™s triangular head contains a hollow spot between the eyes and nostrils called a pit. This pit is actually a sensory organ that helps the rattlesnake hunt in darkness by detecting body heat."

            description: "Regal horned lizards already have supersharp survival instincts when they hatch in late summer. Their sticky tongues are ready to snap out like rubber bands and catch spiders, sow bugs, and ants. And if predators such rattlesnakes and road runners put regal horned lizards on the menu, theyâ€™re in for a challenge. The reptiles rock at hide-and-seek. They can change colors to blend in with almost anything in their desert homes. If that doesnâ€™t work, the lizards suck in air to inflate like a balloon. Then they seem too big to gobble up!As a last resort, the reptiles are able to burst the blood vessels near their eyeballs to trigger a surprise spray. They aim the blood toward the predatorâ€™s mouthâ€”itâ€™s the bad taste that sends enemies running."
